# marketing-analytics-data
In this project, I will perform exploratory data analyses, data visualization and statistical analysis utilizing machine learning algorithms. 

More precisely:
- Customers' expenditures on different product categories will be predicted by applying linear regression analyses. 
- Acceptance of the most recent marketing campaign will be regressed on customer data using logistic regression.
- Importance of individual features in the model predicting response is assessed by implementing a Random Forest Classifier.
- Finally, customer segmentation will be performed by using the k-means approach.
